				<h2>What is Standardized Testing?</h2>
				<h3>It is a test that is given to students and the questions and scoring are purely equal manner. The idea is that it shows where students and teachers are in their skills and how much they've grown, or gotten worse.</h3>

			<div>
				<h2>So, what about it?</h2>
				<h3>The question is: does it actually do what it's supposed to? Do they show growth, or do they just show who's good at taking tests? Are they equal, or is there bias? These are the questions I'll be answering.</h3>
